[Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) is a global,
online program focused on bringing new contributors into open source software development.
GSoC Contributors work with an open source organization on a 12+ week programming project
under the guidance of mentors.
Gradle has participated in GSoC since 2023.

## GSoC 2025

In 2025, we plan to participate under the umbrella of the [Kotlin Foundation](https://kotlinfoundation.org/).
There might be related projects in other mentoring organizations.

### Project Ideas

#### ðŸ““ Kotlin DSL documentation samples test framework

Many projects, including Gradle, have a lot of Kotlin DSL samples and code snippets (see the Gradle Docs for examples). Testing them against multiple versions poses certain challenges because the snippets often represent incomplete code for the sake of brevity. We would like to build a test framework that simplifies the verification of those samples within a unit test framework (Kotest or JUnit 5) on GitHub Actions and Teamcity.

* Complexity: Easy or Medium, 90 hrs or 175 hrs
* Deliverables: Implementing extensibility features in the Kotlin DSL for Gradle and improving support for common project integrations
* Skills to improve: Kotlin, Gradle, Java, Static Analysis
* Potential Mentors: Oleg Nenashev

### For Contributors/Mentees

See the project descriptions for references to particular newcomer-friendly issues or
learning scenarios.
If nothing is available there, it is recommended to start learning Gradle basics, if you aren't already familiar with them.
Then, we recommend looking into some of the newcomer-friendly issues in the target project or in Gradle as whole.
Prior track of contributions during the application phase is important during the project proposal reviews,
because it helps us to build impression about the candidate.

To get started:

1. Join the `#gsoc` channel on the [Gradle community Slack](https://gradle.org/slack-invite).
  If there are such channels in the foundations, please join them too
2. Explore the [Getting Started with Gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/getting_started_eng.html) and the relevant [topic-specific Gradle Guides](https://gradle.org/guides/)
3. Check out the [contributing guidelines](../../contributing/README.md), try addressing some of the newcomer friendly issues
4. Discuss the project ideas with your mentors on the public channels

- [Best practices for GSoC contributors](https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/students/),
  by the Jenkins community - we will be using a similar framework

### For Mentors

We invite Gradle community members, if they are interested in mentoring, to submit their project ideas.

Mentoring requires a time commitment of several hours a week.
It is a great opportunity to have someone prototyping your idea
that it is not on the short term roadmap
but remains interesting to you and valuable to the Gradle community.
