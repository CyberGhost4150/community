# Gradle in Hacktoberfest

[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/) is a month-long celebration of open-source projects, their maintainers, and the global community of contributors.
Many maintainers within the Gradle ecosystem, such as those behind the
[Gradle plugin for Jenkins](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gradle), already include their projects in Hacktoberfest.

In 2024, we’re excited to join as an organization and will be offering special-edition swag to key contributors.
