# Contributing to the Gradle Cookbook

[![a](https://img.shields.io/badge/slack-%23docs-brightgreen?style=flat&logo=slack)](../contributing/community-slack.md)


The Gradle Cookbook is under active development.
Any contributions are welcome!

## Discuss

- `#docs` on the [Gradle Community Slack](../contributing/community-slack.md)
- [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/gradle/community/issues)

## HOWTOs

### Editing and Adding Pages

A few tips:

- All the pages on this site are written in Markdown.
- If needed, we have various tools available, such as code templates and macros, and we can add more MkDocs plugins if necessary.
- The Table of Contents is currently located in [mkdocs.yml](../../mkdocs.yml).
When adding new pages, please update the ToC to ensure they are discoverable.

### Adding New Categories

At the moment, we add categories based on consensus.
If you plan to add a new major category, it's better to discuss it in advance.
